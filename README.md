This is my graduation project 
This project aims to reduce medication errors by connecting patients with doctors and pharmacists in a seamless way. Medication errors contribute significantly to healthcare costs, with an estimated annual cost of $177 billion in the United States alone. Our website addresses this issue by allowing doctors to focus on diagnosing patients, while pharmacists take responsibility for prescribing medications. This system ensures that the right medicine is prescribed based on the pharmacist's expertise, reducing the risk of drug errors and improving patient safety. Additionally, the platform helps patients locate nearby pharmacies where their prescribed medication is available, all while mitigating the risks associated with traditional paper prescriptions.
